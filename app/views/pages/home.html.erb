    <p>Hello I'm Andrew and I am a developer currently living in <strong>Tuscaloosa, Alabama.</strong></p>
    <p>By day I'm an Inventory Manager and a Computer Networking Specialist for a small business in Tuscaloosa.
      By night I'm working on webapps that will help people to get things done faster, or brushing up on my system administration skills.
    I enjoy teaching people what I know on the side and enjoy blogging when I remember to do so.</p>
    <p>You can find me on <a href="#">Twitter</a> or on other social media sites by looking up Andrew Fomera. If you are also a code-junkie you can find me on GitHub. </p>
